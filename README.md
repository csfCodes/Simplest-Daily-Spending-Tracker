# Simplest_Daily_Spending_Tracker
This is the most simplest Daily Expense Tracker written in VbScript which you can ever find on internet  üòâ . 

This was created for my personal use. 
I was fed up with unwanted functionalities like category, budget etc., which was making it hard to log expenses quickly and consistentely on daily basis. So ...

**Features and Uses** :- 
Yess, i know, many of you might be thinking why would i use this if it is just writing in text files? I can enter directly in a text files.
--> I agree to certain extent but here are the issues in directly writting it text files:
1) Formatting the texts when entered directly. This keeps a proper formatting for all transactions entered.
2) Speed: This takes only 2 inputs - as thing on which money spent on and amount spent. if we have to enter 10 transactions all you have to give are these to input for each transactions and hit enter. This is fast.
3) Day's total amount spent is not displayed automatically in a text file.
4) Need to enter date each time manually in a text file. This does it every time you run it.
5) If we need to see only daily spent in a text file then we need to scroll up and down. This keeps daily total spends in a saperate file.
6) Maintain file names and remember the file name which we were entering. Here you don't have to do it.
7) This updates the files dynamically with every input.
8) And o'course, using GUI is fun than a dry notepad to write. It doesn't motivate to do it consistently.

I know, enough of this blabbering right! ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Hehehe, let's see how to use it ...

**How to use** :-
1) Download the zip file from the repo which has only one file ( Duh! along with this README file.  üòú )
2) Keep it anywhere in your system.
3) Double click on the file.
4) Enter the name of the thing on which money was spent like cake, movie, ice cream etc.,
5) Hit Enter.
6) Enter how much was spent.
7) Hit Enter.
8) It will ask you if you have another transaction to enter, if you hit "Yes" button then it will take you to point no. (4). This can be down infinitely.
9) If you click on "No" button, then it will display all the list of transactions happened today with Today's total amount spent.
10) Voila!, That's it.

**Files and folders** :- 
1. Applicaton file (Daily Expense Tracker.vbs) - To run (Just double click and do what the UI says).
2. A fileder (All Records) - This along with 2 text files with in this folder gets created after entering a transaction.
      1. Daily Expense Records.txt - This has each and every transactions which you have entered. Don't worry about running the application more than once in a day or entering the date. It is all taken care of. This can be used for referring old data for your analysis.
      2. Daily Total Spendings.txt - This has total amount spent each day written clearly.
