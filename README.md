# Simplest_Daily_Spending_Tracker
This is the most simplest Daily Expense Tracker written in VbScript which you can ever find on internet ðŸ˜‰. 

This was created for my personal use but then though of sharing it. 
I was fed up with unwanted functionalities like category, budget etc., which was making it hard to log expenses quickly and consistentely on daily basis. So ...

**Features and Uses** :- 
Yess ..., i know, many of you might be thinking why would i use this if it is just writing in text files? I can enter directly in a text file, right?
--> Wrong, you see, i agree to certain extent but here are the issues with directly logging in text files:
1) Formatting of the texts when entered directly. This keeps pretty formatting for all transactions entered.
2) Speed -> This takes only 2 inputs - which are: thing on which money was spent on and amount spent. if we have to enter 10 transactions all you have to give are these 2 inputs for each transactions and hit enter. This is blaze.
3) Day's total amount spent is not displayed automatically in a text file.
4) Need to enter date each time manually in a text file. App does it every time you run it automatically.
5) If we need to see only the daily total spent in a text file then we will have to scroll up and down. This keeps daily total spends in a saperate file again with pretty formatting.
6) Maintaining file names and remembering file names which we were entering. Here you don't have to.
7) This updates the files dynamically with every input.
8) And o'course, using GUI is fun than a dry notepad to write. It doesn't motivate you to do it consistently.

I know, enough of this blabbering right! ... Hehehe, let's see how to use it now ...
